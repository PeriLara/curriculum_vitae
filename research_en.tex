\runsubsection{{{Deep Neural Network for targeted sentiment analysis}}}\\
\location{SESAMm}
Implementation of neural models for targeted sentiment analysis with experimentation on BERT (contextual word embeddings). \\
BERT Finetuning on financial data and transfer learning between a generalist targeted sentiment analysis and an applied to finance one. \\
\textbullet{} Pytorch \textbullet{} BERT \textbullet{} ELMo

\runsubsection{{{Deep Neural Network for Dependency Parsing}}}\\
\location{Master (2nd year) - Computational Linguistics}
Implementation of a dependency parser by transitions from a tagger. The input sentence is encoded by two bi-lstm, which will serve as features to make transition decisions. The arc-standard algorithm is used. \\
\textbullet{} Pytorch

\runsubsection{{{Deep Neural Network from the scratch for POS Tagging}}}\\
\location{Master (1st year) - Computational Linguistics}
Creating a deep neural network from the scratch with forward propagation based on the abstraction of the computation graph and a stochastic gradient descent, training method for the task of Part Of Speech Tagging. 
\textbullet{} Numpy
